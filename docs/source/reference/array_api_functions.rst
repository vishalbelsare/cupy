Array API Functions
===================

.. note::
   ``cupy.array_api`` will be removed in CuPy v14 because its NumPy counterpart ``numpy.array_api`` has been removed.
   The root module ``cupy.*`` is now compatible with the Array API specification as it mirrors the NumPy v2 API.
   Use the `Array API compatibility library <https://data-apis.org/array-api-compat/>`_ to develop applications compatible with various array libraries, including CuPy, NumPy, and PyTorch.

This section is a full list of implemented APIs. For the detailed documentation, see the
`array API specification <https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/API_specification/index.html>`_.
